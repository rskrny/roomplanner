# MVP Build Plan (Condensed)

Goal: working demo to ingest public product data for London, filter by price/size, visualize “does it fit?” with a simple overlay, and link out to buy.

## Phases
1. **Skeleton** – set up backend and frontend.
2. **Ingestion** – parse product feeds and build catalog.
3. **Fit Check** – implement dimension comparison logic.
4. **2D Overlay** – overlay product images on room photos.
5. **Polish** – deploy, documentation, and feedback.

Refer to the README and project documentation for detailed tasks and steps.
