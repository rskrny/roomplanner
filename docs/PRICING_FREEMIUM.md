# Pricing & Freemium Structure

RoomPlanner will be offered under a freemium model that balances user accessibility with a sustainable revenue stream.

## Free Tier
- **2 free scans per account**: Users can upload up to two room scans (photo or video) to test the AI-driven extraction and basic room visualization.
- **Limited catalog access**: Access to a curated subset of the product database, primarily mainstream brands like IKEA and Amazon and a handful of London-based shops.
- **Basic filters**: Ability to filter items by price range, basic dimensions and general categories (e.g., sofa, chair, table).

## Subscription Tier
- **Unlimited scans**: Subscribers can scan and visualize an unlimited number of rooms.
- **Full catalog access**: Unlock the entire product catalog including local boutiques, independent craftsmen, and premium international brands.
- **Advanced features**: Save multiple rooms and mood boards, create shopping lists, export AR models for mobile visualization, and access personalised recommendations.
- **Early access & perks**: Gain early access to new features and exclusive promotions. Pricing is tentatively set around Â£3 per month but may change as features expand and the catalog grows.

## Future Considerations
The freemium structure is designed to encourage trial while providing enough value in the free tier to showcase the platform. Pricing and limits can be adjusted based on user feedback and usage patterns. Additional tiers or one-time purchase options (e.g. pay-per-scan) may be introduced later.
